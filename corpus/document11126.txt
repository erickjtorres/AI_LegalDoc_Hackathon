GDPR Privacy Policy Checklist

If your company is a data controller under the GDPR (for US companies, follow this flowchart), then your company will need to update its privacy policy or privacy notice. Under the GDPR privacy policies must contain more detailed disclosures, while also being understandable and accessible. Even under the current privacy laws, EU regulators have demonstrated they will enforce rules on transparency in privacy disclosures. On February 16, 2018, a Belgian court threatened to fine Facebook US $125 million for failure to disclose its personal data collection practices. These fines may be steeper after May 25th since the GDPR increases the maximum penalties.

Use the checklist below to identify the key disclosure requirements for privacy policies.
