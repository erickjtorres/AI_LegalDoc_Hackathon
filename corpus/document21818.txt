Application

The Department of Immigration and Border Protection (the Department) is collecting your personal information and the personal information of your associates for the purposes of assessing and determining your application for, and ongoing eligibility to maintain, a Customs Broker Licence.

Failure to provide your personal information or the information requested about third parties associated with you will result in the Department not being able to make a determination as to your entitlement to hold, or maintain, a Customs Broker Licence and may result in you not being eligible to have non-public access to the Department's assets.

The Department will use and disclose the personal information that you provide to undertake relevant background checks in order to identify any factors or personal circumstances that pose an integrity risk to you or the Department. It will assess whether you are suitable for association with the Department or to have access to its non-public assets.

In all cases, the following checks will probably be conducted with Australian and/or overseas persons and authorities, as required:
 corroboration of any previous employment, whether Australian Government or private sector, to determine employment history and any matters relating to code of conduct, service records, discipline records, professional conduct and behaviour in the workplace
 corroboration of any past/present security records, including requesting any personal security file
 corroboration of places of residence
 checks to verify the authenticity and validity of personal and identity documents, including but not limited to:  birth, marriage and change of name documentation  naturalisation/citizenship/visa documentation and passports, and  driver licences and Medicare cards.
The following checks/inquiries may also be made with Australian and/or overseas persons and authorities, as required:
 checks of claimed educational qualifications with relevant institutions  checks of travel activity, migration related activity and corroboration of overseas travel  inquiries with financial institutions and others with whom you have financial dealings  inquiries into criminal associations/associations with groups perceived by the community to be engaged in criminal activity  inquiries into criminal or unlawful activity you have been or may be engaged in or associated with  checks of professional associations  checks of involvement in civil legal proceedings  checks of criminal and traffic history  checks of involvement in criminal investigations or proceedings  inquiries into illicit drug use  checks of import and export activity  inquiries into your dealings with the Department  checks of firearm, driver or other licences  inquiries with previous employers (your present employer will not be contacted without your specific consent)
 inquiries with nominated and in some cases un-nominated character referees and associates about your general character and/or information about your suitability to hold a Customs Broker licence or association with the Department
 checks/inquiries with other agencies or organisations where, after considering the information you provide for the purposes of applying for and maintaining your ongoing eligibility for a Customs Broker licence, it becomes apparent that the other agency or organisation may be able to contribute information relevant to the assessment of your suitability for association with the Department.

When conducting these checks/inquiries, the Department will generally only provide the relevant Australian and/or overseas persons or authorities with your identifying information, unless it is necessary in order to conduct the particular check or inquiry to give them other information you have provided for the purpose of applying for and maintaining your ongoing eligibility for a Customs Broker licence.

Each and any of the third parties to whom the Department discloses your personal information will examine their information holdings relating to you and may disclose your personal information or the personal information of your associates to the Department and to each other, where the disclosure is necessary and related to assessing and determining your application for, and ongoing eligibility to maintain a Customs Broker Licence.

National Police History Check
A national police history check is an integral part of the assessment of your suitability. You should note that the existence of a record does not mean that you will be assessed automatically as being unsuitable. Each case will be assessed on its merit, so it is in your interest to provide full and frank details to support your application for a Customs Broker licence. Information will be forwarded to the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission and other Australian police agencies for checking. By signing the general consent form you are consenting to these agencies accessing their records to obtain and disclose police history information that relates to you to the Department. Police history information may include outstanding charges, and criminal convictions/findings of guilt recorded against you that may be disclosed according to the laws of the relevant jurisdiction and, in the absence of any laws governing the release of that information, according to the relevant jurisdiction's information release policy.
Spent Convictions Scheme
The following information is provided as general guidance and is not exhaustive. The aim of Spent Convictions legislation is to prevent discrimination on the basis of certain previous convictions. Spent convictions legislation limits the use and disclosure of older, less serious convictions and findings of guilt. Spent convictions of specific offences will be released where the check is required for certain purposes regardless of how old the convictions are. Each Australian police agency will apply the relevant Spent Convictions legislation/information release policy prior to disclosure. If you require further information or clarification please contact the individual police agencies directly for further information about their release policies and any legislation that affects them.
I have spent/old convictions, do I need to disclose these to the Department?
In certain circumstances an applicant is not required to disclose spent/old convictions. This right to not disclose varies depending upon the nature of your conviction, and the jurisdiction in which the spent convictions were recorded. The Department may, where the relevant legislation allows it, access information about spent/old convictions whether or not a prospective applicant for a position voluntarily provides this information to the Department. If you have convictions in Victoria there is no legislative right that allows you not to disclose your conviction. All Victorian convictions must be disclosed. DIBP can access spent convictions under the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914, and convictions recorded in South Australia, for the purposes of assessing prospective job applications because the relevant legislation allows it to do so. You are advised to seek independent legal advice if you think that you may have a spent/old conviction and that you have a right to not disclose this conviction. Please note that people with criminal records are not automatically barred from applying for a licence. Each application will be considered on its merits.
