ACCEPTABLE USE AND PRIVACY POLICY
METRONET has formulated this Acceptable Use and Privacy Policy ("AUPP"), in order to set forth terms regarding the responsible use of METRONET's network and any associated equipment, systems, Internet services, e-mail accounts and web sites (collectively the "Services") by our customers and other users of the Services (collectively, "Users"). This AUPP applies to your Internet Services only.
PLEASE READ THIS ACCEPTABLE USE AND PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE USING ANY THE SERVICE(S). BY USING ANY PART OF THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AUPP AS SPECIFIED BELOW AND TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SERVICE IN THE AGREEMENT YOU SIGNED WITH METRONET WHEN SERVICE WAS INSTALLED AT YOUR PREMISES ("Terms and Conditions").

You should visit the AUPP and Terms and Conditions often to be aware of any updates.
Privacy Policy
METRONET respects the privacy of its Users. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to explain the types of information METRONET obtains about Users, how the information is obtained, how it is used, how it may be disclosed to others, and how Users may restrict its use or disclosure. This Privacy Policy, although consistent with METRONET's Cable Television Privacy Policy, only applies to METRONET's Internet Services.
Personally Identifiable Information: The only personally identifiable information METRONET obtains about individual Users through the Services it provides is information supplied voluntarily by the User. Users may provide METRONET with name, address, telephone number, billing information, email address, domain name or URL or other personally identifiable information that METRONET may use for its own business purposes. METRONET may share such information with its partners which perform certain services for METRONET and such partners shall have access to User information, to the extent needed to perform their services or as necessary to advance METRONET business purposes, including the purpose of contacting Users about new products and services, which may be of specific interest to Users. However, our partners may not use such User information for any other purpose.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information: METRONET does collect some non-personally identifiable generic information about Users as a means of measuring the effectiveness of the Services. METRONET servers monitor and identify certain User information in the normal course of operation. We collect this information only in the aggregate and use it to evaluate and improve the Services delivered and to provide targeted information that may be of interest to Users. The following are examples of non-personally identifiable generic information.
IP Addresses: An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to a User's computer whenever that User is using the World Wide Web. Web site servers can automatically identify individual computers by their IP address. METRONET collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information. METRONET does not intentionally link IP addresses to any personally identifiable information.
Cookies: Cookies are pieces of information that are used for record-keeping purposes. Cookies allow METRONET to save certain information about a User, such as a password or individual preferences, in order to facilitate and enhance the User's future use of the Services. METRONET will not use cookies to retrieve information from a User's computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. Except as otherwise provided in this policy, METRONET shall not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, and shall not share that information with any third parties for any reason.
Computer Settings: Settings, technical and other information from your computer, such as your operating system, browser version, connectivity, various communication parameters and other information related to the operation and interaction of the Services may be collected by METRONET. Except as otherwise provided in this policy, METRONET will use such information solely in order to provide technically appropriate formatting of information provided by METRONET and access to the Services. The collection of this information will not include any personally identifiable information about you or any individual User.

General Conduct
The Services may be used only for lawful purposes. Transmission, distribution or storage of any material in violation of any applicable law or regulation coming to or from any unauthorized network or system is prohibited. Unlawful purposes include, without limitation, unauthorized use of any of the following: material protected by copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property rights; government and military data protected by law and national security; or, university and academic data protected by public policy; or dissemination of material that is obscene; defamatory; or, constitutes wire fraud; an illegal threat; is abusive; obstructive; an invasion of privacy; harassing or libelous; or violates export control laws; or that constitutes "Hate Speech;" or that encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, gives rise to civil liability, or otherwise violates any law. Any violation of the above, which compromises the integrity of the Services or any other network, is strictly prohibited. Users shall not use the Services in a manner that may expose METRONET to criminal or civil liability. Users are further prohibited from assisting any other person in violating any part of this AUPP.
Non-Participation: Any User who does not wish to receive further contacts from METRONET should send a written request that METRONET not contact the `non-participating' User. Please send the written request by U.S. mail in an envelope clearly marked "Privacy-Urgent" to METRONET 8837 Bond Street, Overland Park, KS 66214, Attn: Cinergy MetroNet, Legal Counsel.
Disclosure Pursuant to Legal Process: METRONET shall, pursuant to applicable law, regulation or legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order, allow access to all available and relevant User information in order to comply with such process and protect METRONET's or a User's rights and property. METRONET may also allow access to this User information in special emergencies where physical safety is at risk.
Transfer of Business Assets: METRONET considers its User information to be one of its business assets. Should METRONET sell or transfer all or substantially all of its business assets to another entity, the User information will be transferred as a business asset.
Third Party Web Sites: METRONET is not responsible for the content or the privacy practices of third party Web sites, including Web sites reached through the Services. Other Web sites may have different privacy policies, or no policy. Users should review the privacy policies of any Web site before providing personal information.
METRONET RESERVES THE RIGHT TO MODIFY THE PRIVACY POLICY FROM TIME TO TIME IF IT MODIFIES ITS PRACTICES REGARDING THE COLLECTION OR USE OF USER INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM USERS IN THE FUTURE.

E-Mail Policy
METRONET may, in its sole discretion, assign to User the right to use multiple e-mail accounts as part of User's Internet Services. User shall be responsible for all e-mail accounts assigned to User by METRONET regardless of whether User personally uses such accounts. User agrees to use all e-mail accounts assigned to User by METRONET for lawful purposes only. METRONET reserves the right to suspend the use of any free e-mail account assigned to User for any reason. Without limiting the foregoing, METRONET will automatically delete any e-mail account that has not been used by User for three hundred sixty (360) consecutive days. User will lose all access to any e-mail account assigned to User by METRONET within twenty eight (28) days of the termination of User's Internet Service for any reason.

Responsibility for Content

In the event that METRONET becomes aware that any such material created by Users may violate any part of this AUPP and/or may expose METRONET to civil or criminal liability, METRONET reserves the right to block access to such material, and suspend or terminate Services provided to any User creating, storing or disseminating such material. METRONET further reserves the right to cooperate with legal authorities and third parties in the investigation of alleged wrongdoing, including disclosing the identity of the User that METRONET deems responsible for the wrongdoing.
Inappropriate Content
Users shall not use the Services to transmit, distribute or store material that is illegal, as reasonably determined by federal law or by any regulatory authority or METRONET, including but not limited to illegal pornographic material (including child pornography), defamatory, libelous, threatening, harassing, abusive, hateful, or excessively violent material.
Intellectual Property
Material accessible through the Services may be subject to protection under privacy, publicity, or other personal rights and Intellectual Property rights, including but not limited to, copyrights and laws protecting patents, trademarks, trade secrets or other proprietary information.
