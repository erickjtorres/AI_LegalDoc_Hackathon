by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer.
Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of Forever Resorts' essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on.
Disclosure of Your Information Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below and with subsidiaries. You agree that we have the right to disclose your personal information as needed to conduct our business activities according to the following, and in the following, circumstances:
 Internal Disclosure: We necessarily require storage and disclosure of your information within our various business units on an as-needed basis in order to effectively conduct our legitimate business activities.
 Third-Party Service Providers: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions in accordance with contractual obligations but may not use it for other purposes.
 Promotional Offers: From time to time, we send offers to selected groups of Forever Resorts customers on behalf of other Forever Resorts properties and services. Customers are free to opt-out of these promotional offers at any time on the website or by contacting our Office by telephone at 877-386-4383.
 Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy properties, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred and/or shared business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Forever Resorts assets are acquired, customer information will be one of the transferred assets.
 Protection of Forever Resorts and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Forever Resorts, our customers, or others. This may include exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or

otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.
 With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might be sent to other third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.
Where We Store Your Personal Information The information that we collect from you will be transferred to, and stored at, a destination in the United States, outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It will also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who are employed by one or more of our Forever Resort locations. This includes staff engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your reservation, the processing of your payment details, and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal information, you agree to its transfer, storing, or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Notice.
All information you provide to us is stored on secure servers. We maintain a wide variety of programs and security and controls to protect your information. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. We follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) when handling credit card data. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.
Access, Control, and Your Rights If you created an account during the reservation process, you can view, update, and delete certain information about yourself and your interactions with Forever Resorts. If you have a reservation confirmation number, you may be able to change and update your reservation. If you cannot access or update your information yourself, you can always contact us for assistance.
If you wish to exercise any of your rights as a data subject or discuss your rights, please let us know using any of the contact information in the introduction to this Privacy Notice. We may ask you to provide valid form of identification for verification purposes. Your rights are as follows:
