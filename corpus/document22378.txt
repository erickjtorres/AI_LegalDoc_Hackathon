SUBSCRIBER PRIVACY NOTICE
This Subscriber Privacy Notice ("Notice") applies to subscribers of services provided by cable systems controlled by Mediacom Communications Corporation or its affiliates and subsidiaries ("Services"). Services are our:
 Cable television service, including video-on-demand and pay-per-view service  Internet access service  Phone service  Home or premises security or monitoring services
In providing Services, we obtain information about you and your use of those Services. This Notice tells you our policies regarding the collection, retention, use and disclosure of that information. It applies to all kinds of accounts, including residential, commercial and governmental. If you are a non-residential subscriber, you may have a separate agreement with us that has terms that differ from these policies. If so, that separate agreement will govern.
We sometimes use the word "customer," "you" or "your" to refer to any subscriber to a Service and to the operator of the relevant cable system as "Mediacom" "we," "our" or "us."
We sometimes try to help you understand a statement we make by giving an illustration using the words "for example," "such as," "includes," "including" or something similar. When doing this, we do not intend to limit the scope of the statement to just the specified items or situations.
Some information is obtained when a Service is used, but we typically cannot tell if the actual user is you (the account holder) or someone else using your account, such as a spouse, child, employee or visitor/guest. Because such usage is through devices associated with or logged into your account, we attribute all usage data to you and treat it in the same way as we describe for information about your personal usage. You should assure that people who use the Services through your account are aware of the policies in this Notice.
In general, our policies apply to your interaction with us as a customer, whether "online" (such as when you subscribe to a Service on our website) or "offline" (such as when you subscribe using the phone or at one of our offices). For our websites, additional online privacy policies may apply that cover topics relevant to website visitors, such as the use of "cookies." Also, if you visit a Mediacom website for purposes unrelated to your subscription for a Service, this Notice will not apply to that interaction. Instead, the separate online privacy notice for that website will govern. You can find the separate website privacy notice by clicking on the "Privacy Policy" or similar link.
The Services may allow you to interact with companies and individuals who Mediacom does not control. By doing so, you may enable them to independently learn information about you. In addition, cable boxes, DVRs, modems and other devices used to provide our Services are manufactured and supplied to us by third parties that we do not control. In theory, the devices could be set up to gather information about usage or even monitor activities at your service location and report the data back to some third party. The policies in this Notice do not apply to information that you independently provide to any third party; Mediacom is not responsible or liable for any third party's collection, use or disclosure of any such information.
Special Rules Apply to "Personally Identifiable Information" and "Consumer Proprietary Network Information"
Some information about you and your account that Mediacom knows or learns is "personally identifiable." Information is "personally identifiable" if it identifies or can reasonably be used to figure out the identity of a specific customer, such as name and street address, telephone number or email address. It can also include other information that is linked to an identified customer. Information that is not linked to personal identifiers, such as your name or address, is not "personally identifiable." Information can begin as personally identifiable, but become "de-identified" or anonymous because it is separated from your name or information that identifies you as a person. Sometimes data that is anonymous could be made personally identifiable if we link it to other information that identifies you as a person.
To illustrate, your gender and age would be "personally identifiable" if combined with your name or other information that can readily be used to identify you. Similarly, television viewing, Internet navigation or phone usage data would be "personally identifiable" if linked with your name or address. However, none of these kinds of information would be "personally identifiable" if separated from your name and other identifying data.
The distinction between information that is or is not personally identifiable is important because two sets of provisions in a Federal law, the Communications Act of 1934, impose specific obligations upon us with respect to personally identifiable customer information: (1) Section 631 of the Communications Act, which applies to cable television and certain other services offered by cable companies (we call this the "Cable Privacy Law") and (2) Section 222 of the Communications Act, which applies to telecommunications services (we call this the "Telecommunications Privacy Law").

PN052015

Our privacy policies for all of our Services are based at least in part on the Cable Privacy Law. The Cable Privacy Law imposes restrictions on cable operators' collection and disclosure of personally identifiable information related to the relevant services. As described in more detail in this Notice:
 A cable system generally may be used to collect personally identifiable information concerning a subscriber only
 with his or her prior written or electronic consent;  in order to render cable or other services to that subscriber; or  to detect unauthorized reception.
 Subject to certain exceptions, cable operators may not disclose personally identifiable information about a subscriber except
 as necessary to render Service to that subscriber or conduct a related, legitimate business activity; or  with the subscriber's consent.
 Before complying with a demand by someone for information about you, we may have to notify you and you may have the right to contest the disclosure in a court. There are exceptions, such as some requests by law enforcement.
Our obligations and your rights under the Cable Privacy Law do not apply to information that is not "personally identifiable."
If you subscribe to Mediacom phone Service or any other Service classified as a "telecommunications service," the Telecommunications Privacy Law creates certain additional customer rights and obligations on our part with respect to a category of information known as "customer proprietary network information" or "CPNI."CPNI generally relates to the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, location and amount of your use of the relevant Service and that is made available to us solely by virtue of our customer relationship with you. CPNI also includes information in your bills pertaining to your phone Service. Individual elements of CPNI in isolation may or may not be personally identifiable information depending upon whether or not that element personally identifies you. CPNI does not include so-called "subscriber list information," which is any information that (1) identifies the listed names of our phone subscribers and their phone numbers, addresses and "primary advertising classifications" and (2) that we have published, caused to be published, or accepted for publication in any directory format. Our obligations and your rights under the Telecommunications Privacy Law do not apply to information that is not "CPNI." Pursuant to an order of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), our Internet access service is scheduled to become classified as a "telecommunications service" subject to the Telecommunications Privacy Law in June 2015, but not to the FCC's related rules implementing that law, many of which were designed specifically for telephone service. We will take reasonable, good faith steps to protect the CPNI of our broadband customers in accordance with the Telecommunications Privacy Law, as applicable and as described in this Notice.
If your rights under the Cable Privacy Law or the Telecommunications Privacy Law are violated, then you have certain rights and remedies, as discussed under the caption "Remedies If Your Rights Are Violated" below.
The Cable Privacy Law requires that each subscriber to a relevant service be furnished with a separate, written statement about the cable operator's privacy policies concerning personally identifiable information at the time of entering into an agreement for the service and at least annually thereafter. This Notice is intended to be Mediacom's required statement. Accordingly, in following sections of this Notice, we describe our policies regarding the following six topics required by the Cable Privacy Law:
 The kinds of personally identifiable information we collect.  How we use that information.  The nature, frequency and purpose of any disclosure we may make of that information and the types of persons
and entities to which the disclosure may be made.  The period during which we will keep that information.  The choices available to you regarding collection, use and disclosure of that information, the times and places at
which you may have access to that information.  Certain rights you may have regarding that information.  The Kinds of Personally Identifiable Information We Collect And How We Get It
We obtain various kinds of information about you or the use of your Services in a number of different ways. Subject to our policies in this Notice and applicable law, this may include any or all of the following:
Information You Furnish or Other Basic Account Information. When you sign up for a Service or during the course of your customer relationship with us, you may give us information we use to set up and manage your account and related purposes. Such information may include your name, service address, billing address, work address, email address, home telephone number,
2
PN052015

work telephone number, mobile phone number, date of birth, social security number, driver's license number, credit card, debit card and bank account information and other financial and non-financial information.
Depending on the Services we provide, we may collect other information, such as the Service options you have chosen; the features and functionalities of our Services and equipment that you access or use; the number, location within your home and configuration of television sets, converters, modems, personal computers, telephones or other Service-related equipment; equipment maintenance and repair records; a record of whether you rent or own your service location; a record of any violations and alleged violations of Service terms or policies; complaints or requests or legal demands for information made by third parties.
We record and store written, email, telephone or other communications with you, such as your inquiries or complaints or responses to customer satisfaction surveys or other inquiries we initiate.
Virtually all of these kinds of information can be or become personally identifiable because the data are or can be linked to your name, address or other identifiers. In fact, because of the nature of the sorts of information referred to above and what we use it for, it ordinarily will be in personally identifiable form. However, when we no longer need it in personally identifiable form, we can make it anonymous by delinking it from your name, address or other information that identifies you as a person.
Data from Our Records and Third Parties. We may use the data we have about you to gather additional information from our records or third parties. For example, when you order a Service, we may check our records to see if you were previously our customer, if so, whether there is an outstanding balance. As another example, we may obtain information about your credit record from a credit reporting agency or other source in order to assess your creditworthiness. As discussed more below, we may also obtain data about you or your household, business or organization from marketing, consumer research and other companies that sell demographic or other information about individuals or businesses they independently collect. Because we use identifying information to gather these kinds of data, it may initially be personally identifiable unless and until we anonymize it by delinking it from such identifying information.
Data Collected Through Our Systems. Our Services require us to connect our facilities with devices that you use to receive Service, such as television cable boxes, DVRs or modems for Internet or phone Service. These connections and your use of them results in the automatic collection by our systems of certain kinds of information. We may also be able to remotely access those devices in your service location to obtain information for network management, diagnostic, troubleshooting or other purposes. The kinds of information we may collect by these means differs depending on the nature of the Service and the technology used to provide it:

 Cable Television Service. If you subscribe to cable television Service, we may automatically collect viewing information when you interact with our systems, such as by changing your television channel, reviewing listings in an electronic program guide, interacting with your DVR or ordering on-demand programming. For example, the cable box or DVR may collect information like guide searches and the selection of a channel to view, program to record or video-on-demand movie or show to watch, in each case including additional data like the date, time and duration of each viewing selection. We sometimes call information of this kind "television viewing data."

 Internet Access Service. If you subscribe to our Internet access Service, our systems may automatically collect information about your Service usage, such as when you log onto or off of the Internet. They are also capable of recording data about your Web usage of the type that is captured by the third parties that own the browsers, search engines and other online resources that you use. We sometimes call these kinds of information "Internet navigation data." We also collect information about resource consumption, such as the amount of "bandwidth" you consume in uploading, downloading and streaming content. In addition, if you take advantage of our offer of email accounts, then we know your email addresses for those accounts and know or have the ability to learn about their use, including the other email addresses with which you communicate and email content. It is our policy not to access email content unless required by law.

 Phone Service. If you subscribe to our phone Service, our systems may automatically collect information about use of that Service, such as the numbers you call or that call you, the duration of calls and the Service features and functions you use and frequency of such use. We sometimes call information of these kinds "phone usage data."

 Security or Monitoring Service. If you subscribe to our Mediacom home or premises security or monitoring Service, we may collect information about your use of the Service, including alarm status, system activations and deactivations, alarm detail and history and status history of any monitored devices such as thermostat settings and internal temperatures. If we provide you with video monitoring Services, we may view video feeds from your service address during installation, while troubleshooting, when performing maintenance and during emergencies (as determined by us in our reasonable discretion).


PN052015

Device Identifiers. In general, each cable box, modem or other device at your service location through which we provide a Service has a unique code or other identifier that we need to know in order to provide that Service. Similarly, we assign a separate "Internet Protocol" or "IP" address to each computer, tablet or other personal
3

device that is used to access the Internet through our Internet access Service, and this is different from the device identifier. We keep records that allow these identifiers to be traced to your account.
 Application Usage. If a device you employ for one of our Services comes with or allows you to install user applications or "apps," our systems may be able to determine the apps you use and collect usage information such as date, time and duration of use.
Ordinarily, television viewing, Internet navigation and other information we collect through service devices or connections is not personally identifiable because it is associated with an anonymous device identifier, IP address or similar code, and not with your name, address or other identifying information. Although we have records that allow us to link the devices to your account, and so we have the practical ability to make such data personally identifiable, we will not do so unless it is for a purpose permitted by the Cable Privacy Law or the Telecommunications Privacy Law (as applicable), such as rendering a Service to you, responding to a subpoena or a purpose for which we have obtained your written or electronic consent. For example, if you buy a video-on-demand or pay-per-view event, we need to match your order through your cable box with your account for billing purposes; therefore, your viewing selection and related information like the date, time and location of viewing will be known to us and personally identified to your account.
If certain usage information about Mediacom's phone Service is combined with data that can be used to identify you, then it will be considered CPNI for purposes of the Telecommunications Privacy Law. The same will be true for our Internet access service once its reclassification as a telecommunications service becomes effective. Please consult the caption "Use and Disclosure of CPNI" below.
The Purposes For Which Mediacom Uses Personally Identifiable Information That's Not CPNI
General Uses. Subject to applicable law, the provisions of this Notice and your "opt-out" rights described below, we use personally identifiable information, that's not CPNI, as necessary to render our Services to you; for related business activities such as account set-up, billing, collection, marketing and customer support; to detect and address unauthorized reception of cable programming; and for tax, legal, accounting and other purposes related to our business, including:
 Ensure you receive the Services for which you have subscribed and perform troubleshooting;  Improve the quality and attractiveness to you of our Services and the ads you see when using some of them;  Make sure you are being billed properly and pay for the Services you receive;  Assess your creditworthiness;  Send you pertinent announcements about the Mediacom Services you receive;  Respond to your questions, issues, orders or requests;  Provide our third-party vendors, agents, consultants and legal, accounting and other advisors with information
reasonably necessary for them to perform their obligations, duties and functions;  Obtain additional information about you or your household, business or organization from third parties;  Send promotional material to you about other products and Services available from Mediacom or others and
determine which such products or Services are most likely to be of interest to you;  Obtain additional information, perform data analyses and work with third parties in order to enhance the value to
you and consistency with your perceived or expressed interests and preferences of the programming, content, advertising and Services that are made available to you, including through delivery to you of customized content and targeted advertising and personalized offers for products and Services that may be of interest to you;  Protect our rights and enforce our terms and policies regarding our Services; and  Investigate and respond to complaints, inquiries or legal process from government, law enforcement, copyright owners or other third parties.
Uses with Your Consent. The Cable Privacy Law allows us to use personally identifiable information for other purposes with your consent. In addition, our written or electronic terms of service for each relevant Service contain a provision constituting your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of information about you and your account as described in this Notice.
Use in Connection with Creating De-Identified Data. Access to aggregate and non-identified data about the users of our Services can be beneficial to us and our customers. For example, information about the relative popularity of channels can help us make decisions about which television networks we should carry, enhance our ability to sell commercial time on those channels or enable us to generate additional revenues by providing that information on an anonymous basis to third parties for their own marketing and other purposes. This might benefit our customers by allowing us to tailor our channel lineup to better match subscriber preferences or to reduce the need for subscriber fee increases by growing non-subscriber revenues.
For these reasons, we may create anonymous pools of data about all or subsets of our subscribers derived from a variety of sources. We might also supplement the information that we already have about our customers with additional data available from independent parties that have accumulated it using their own sources and already identified it with specific individuals without our assistance or involvement.
4
PN052015

To illustrate, we could obtain demographic information about you or your household, business or organization from third parties that independently gather and maintain it; anonymize it by stripping away all personally identifying information; combine it with anonymous television viewing or Internet navigation data associated with your account; aggregate the resulting anonymous data with similar anonymized data obtained for other subscribers; and analyze the data in order to learn information about the interests, needs and preferences of various "audience segments" that are based on common characteristics like age, gender or income. As an alternative to doing this directly or through contractors, we might assist third party advertisers, marketers or consumer data aggregators in compiling pooled, anonymous information through similar processes.
The Cable Privacy Law and the Telecommunications Law do not restrict our discretion in collecting, using and disclosing information that is not personally identifiable. Without limiting that discretion, we might collect, use and disclose the data for internal purposes, such as improving our Services and sales and providing targeted advertising or other communications or content, or we might give third parties access to the data for their own purposes, such as improving the placement of their ads or messages, enhancing the focus of their marketing efforts and increasing sales of their own products and services. For example, if the data indicates that Mediacom's customers, as a whole, who are between the ages of 21 and 25, fall within a certain income range and live within a particular geographic area are more interested in video gaming than golf and watch the Military History channel more than the Golf channel, that information would allow video game sellers to concentrate their ad buys where they would have the most impact and ensure that our customers who like gaming see more relevant ads.
Besides creating pools of aggregated anonymous data, we may sometimes use internally or provide to third parties deidentified data about particular customers' Service usage and characteristics in non-aggregate form, subject to contractual commitments by the third parties designed to protect its anonymity. For example, we might provide individual anonymous information to third parties to analyze for audience measurement and analysis, media research and program rating purposes.
In some cases, it is possible that a third party to whom we make available anonymous data will be able to independently accumulate sufficient additional information to enable your identification from the totality of that data (so-called contextual identification). However, where we have a direct contractual relationship with recipients of anonymous data we provide, we generally seek a commitment that the recipient will not attempt to re-identify our customers. Such a commitment, if obtained, does not guarantee that contextual identification will not occur or that the third party will comply with its commitment.
Disclosure By Mediacom Of Personally Identifiable Information That's Not CPNI
Under this caption, we state our policies regarding disclosures to third parties of personally identifiable information that's not CPNI. Disclosure of CPNI is covered below under the caption "Use and Disclosure of CPNI."
We may disclose personally identifiable information about you with your prior written or electronic consent. Mediacom from time to time may also disclose, without such consent, personally identifiable information about you if necessary to render a cable or other Service to you, or conduct a related, legitimate business activity. The kinds of persons or entities to which we may make such disclosures include the following:
 Mediacom's "affiliates," which are individuals or entities that control, are controlled by or under common control with Mediacom;
 Accountants, lawyers, consultants and other professionals we or our affiliated companies use in our businesses;  Credit reporting and collection agencies;  Third parties that furnish us with services or otherwise assist us in connection with aspects of Mediacom's
business of providing our Services, including, for example, installation and repair, billing, call center, sales and marketing, market research, fulfillment, mailings, data storage, data scrubbing, data analytics and data processing;  Sources of third-party data that is used to compile anonymized, aggregate data as described above; or  Government agencies in connection with complaints that you make to them or for other government purposes.
In addition, Mediacom or its affiliates may disclose such information in connection with an actual or potential direct or indirect transfer of ownership of all or part of Mediacom's business to the potential or actual purchaser, investor or other party and its respective attorneys, accountants and advisors. If we complete a transaction in which a third party gets ownership or control of the cable system that provides your Services, we will ordinarily transfer the personally identifiable information we have to that third party and its privacy policies, not ours, will apply to that information after the transfer.
The Cable Privacy Law also permits us to from time to time disclose lists of our subscribers to third parties for purposes other than those referred to above. Those lists may contain your name and address, so long as we have given you the opportunity to prohibit or limit such disclosure and we do not also directly or indirectly reveal, in personally identifiable form, the extent of any viewing or other use of our cable or other Service subject to the Cable Privacy Law. This permits us, among other things, to disclose your name and address to charities, advertisers, direct mail marketers and telemarketers for use in phone or mail solicitations, market research or other purposes. It also allows us to provide your name and address to third parties in the business of selling information about consumers from a variety of sources to charities, advertisers, marketers and others.
5
PN052015

You have the right to require us to not include your name and address on such a list by "opting out." In order to opt-out, you may complete the "Opt-Out Form" included with this Notice or downloadable at www.mediacomcable.com/privacy or call 1800-747-8021. If you do opt out, your choice will become effective after we have been allowed reasonable processing time. Opting out impacts only disclosure to third parties of your personally identifiable information for their own marketing or business purposes unrelated to your Mediacom Services and not for any other purpose--for example, it would not prohibit disclosure to third parties of de-identified or aggregate information for their own purposes. It also would not prevent Mediacom from using your information to market our own and third-party products and services to you.
If you use Mediacom's Internet access Service to send or receive an e-mail message or other electronic communication or use our phone Service to store voicemails, a Federal law, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (the "ECPA"), permits us to access the content of those communications. It also permits us to disclose such information to an addressee or intended recipient (or his or her agent); to a person involved in forwarding the information to its destination or when necessarily incident to providing service or protecting our rights or property; or to any one with the consent of the subscriber or an addressee or intended recipient (or his or her agent).
We reserve the right to notify or disclose information to law enforcement or a responsible government official if we believe in good faith there to be an emergency or other exigent circumstances that may make disclosure necessary to protect one or more persons from an imminent danger of death, injury or harm (including self-inflicted).
Finally, disclosures to governmental entities as required by law or a subpoena or legal process are discussed below under the caption "Disclosure to Governmental Agencies or Otherwise Required by Law or Legal Process."
Timing and Frequency of Disclosures
Information we disclose for purposes relating to billing and levels of Service usage is generally provided on a monthly basis. Disclosure for another purpose is provided as and when necessary or convenient in light of the nature of that purpose.
Use And Disclosure Of CPNI
If you are a subscriber to a Mediacom telecommunications Service, then we may only use, disclose and permit access to your individually identifiable CPNI:
 In providing the Service from which the CPNI is derived or other Services necessary to, or used in, providing that Service;
 To initiate, render, bill and collect for phone Services;  To protect our rights or property;  To protect users of our Services and other carriers from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, or subscription to,
such Services;  As required by law; or  With your approval.
We are required to disclose CPNI to any person you designate upon your affirmative written request; however, we will not provide you with records that we otherwise do not create, maintain and furnish in the ordinary course of business (for example, as part of a bill) or which are available only from our archives, without valid legal process such as a court order. Also, if you are a Mediacom phone customer and a third party makes a request that we furnish information for purposes of publishing a directory, we are obligated by the Telecommunications Act to furnish your name, telephone number, address and your "primary advertising classification," as well as any other information that we or an affiliated company has published or caused to be published in any directory format. However, we offer our phone customers the ability to designate their listings as non-published within print or electronic directories or directory assistance services. If you do not exercise that right, your name, address and telephone number may be printed in such directories and with such services. Because of the complexity of this process and the involvement of other entities in the publication, errors may occur from time-to-time.
Your name and/or phone number may also be transmitted and displayed on a Caller ID device unless you have elected to block such information. Please note that Caller ID blocking may not prevent the display of your name and/or phone number when you dial certain business numbers, 911, 900 numbers or toll free numbers.
We may use CPNI generated in furnishing phone Services to you (which we sometimes call "phone CPNI") to market to you, communications-related products or services that are within the same category of Service to which you already subscribe. For instance, we may use phone CPNI to market other telephone Service offerings to you.
We also may use phone CPNI to market to you communications-related products or services that are outside of the category of Service to which you already subscribe. For instance, we may use phone CPNI to market Internet access Service to you. You have the right to restrict our use of your phone CPNI for such purposes. If you wish to do so, please notify us by completing the
6
PN052015

"CPNI Opt-Out Form" included with this Notice. If you do not notify us within 30 days of this notification that you wish to restrict our use of your phone CPNI for purposes of marketing unrelated services to you, we will assume that you approve of our use for this purpose.
Without your permission, we will not use your phone CPNI to offer products or services to you that the FCC classifies as non-communications related (including video services) or that are offered by other companies or by joint ventures in which we have an interest.
Please note that if you opt-out or otherwise deny or restrict our use of your phone CPNI, it will not affect our provision to you of any of our Services. Any permission or denial of permission to use your phone CPNI remains valid until such time as your Mediacom phone service is discontinued or we receive your notice withdrawing permission.
As noted above, we may disclose your CPNI to the extent authorized or required by law. Disclosures to governmental entities as required by law or a subpoena or other legal process are discussed below under the caption "Disclosure to Governmental Agencies or Otherwise Required by Law or Legal Process."
We are also allowed by the Telecommunications Law to use CPNI with your approval. Subject to any provisions of applicable law that cannot be varied, if you use any of our telecommunications Services, then continued use after this Notice is made available to you constitutes your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of information about you and your account as described in this Notice.
Disclosure To Governmental Agencies Or Otherwise Required By Law Or Legal Process
Mediacom will disclose personally identifiable information about you and your use of Services when and in the manner required by law or legal request such as a warrant, subpoena or order issued by a court or an administrative subpoena or national security letter.
In the case of information subject to the Cable Privacy Law, our legal obligations will differ depending on whether the person or entity seeking the information is a governmental authority or not. If a person or entity that is not a governmental agency seeks personally identifiable information, then the Cable Privacy Law permits us to disclose certain information only if there is a court order authorizing or requiring such disclosure and only if we notify you of the order.
If a governmental agency seeks personally identifiable information about you, then the rules are different depending on (1) the nature of the information and (2) the specific Federal laws that apply to the disclosure. If a government agency only wants to know "subscriber record information," then it can require us to furnish it by serving us with an "administrative subpoena" that it issues itself, without the need for approval or other action by a court. Subscriber record information is limited to:
 Subscriber name and address;  Records of local and long distance phone connection and Internet session times and duration;  Length of Service (including start date) and types of Service utilized;  Phone number, instrument number or other subscriber number or identity, including any temporarily assigned
network address; and  The means and source of payment by the subscriber (including any credit card or bank number).
If the governmental agency wants additional information beyond subscriber record information, then it generally needs a warrant or other court order. For example, under the Cable Privacy Law, a governmental agency can obtain information about your selection of video programming only by court order. It can obtain such an order only if the government demonstrates to the court by clear and convincing evidence that you are reasonably suspected of engaging in criminal activity and that the information sought would be material evidence in the case against you. As an absolute precondition to such disclosure, you must be given the opportunity to contest in court any claims made in support of the court order sought by the governmental agency. If the additional information sought by the governmental agency is not records revealing video programming choices, then it must obtain a court order, but it does not have to meet the two special requirements applicable to video viewing records.
The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) allows the government to require us to disclose the content of your emails and other electronic communications to the extent stored on our network. For communications we have stored for 180 days or less, the government must obtain a criminal warrant from a court. For communications stored for more than 180 days, we have to disclose them (i) without prior notice to you if the government obtains a criminal warrant or (ii) with prior notice to you if the government obtains a warrant, subpoena or order from a court, obtains a grand jury or trial subpoena or issues an administrative subpoena. If the government wants us to disclose your subscriber record information but not the content of your communications, then it may require us to do so, without prior notice to you or your consent, by obtaining a criminal warrant or a subpoena or order from a court or by issuing an administrative subpoena.
7
PN052015

Other Federal law authorizes the government to obtain, without notice to you or your consent, a court order requiring us to capture, record and disclose to the government the phone numbers, e-mail addresses and similar identifiers that you call or send communications to or that call you or send you communications using any Mediacom phone or Internet access Service. A federal or state governmental agency may obtain the order upon the certification by the appropriate government lawyer or officer that the information likely to be obtained is relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation.
In addition to the above, if you subscribe to our Internet access or phone Service, the ECPA permits us to disclose the contents of your e-mail or other communications to a law enforcement agency if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of the information without delay. We may do so without prior notice to you, without your consent and without being required to do so by a warrant, subpoena, court order or law. Examples of situations in which we might make such disclosures are where we reasonably believe that there is an immediate risk of suicide or terrorist activity.
We are required by law to notify the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children of information concerning child pornography of which we become aware through the provision of our Services and disclose identifying data.
The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 provides that state welfare agencies may obtain from our subscriber lists the addresses of individuals who owe or are owed child support and the names and addresses of their employers. The law says that this information can be obtained through an administrative subpoena issued by a state's welfare agency, without a court order, and does not require that a customer be given notice of and the opportunity to contest the disclosure.
Sometimes, a copyright owner believes that his or her copyright has been infringed by an Internet user. The owner may know some information, such as the user's e-mail or IP address, but may not know the user's personal identity. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act provides for a copyright owner, under certain circumstances, to obtain a subpoena seeking disclosure from an online service provider of the identity of a user who is believed to have infringed the copyright. If we receive a valid subpoena, we are required to expeditiously identify the alleged infringer.
How Does Mediacom Protect Personally Identifiable Information And CPNI?
We follow industry-standard practices designed to protect against unauthorized access to personally identifiable information or CPNI. However, we cannot guarantee that these practices will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or disclose such information.
Time Period During Which We Retain Personally Identifiable Information
We keep personally identifiable information about you related to a Service in our regular business records while you are a subscriber. We also keep it for a period of time after you are no longer a subscriber if necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or to satisfy legal requirements. These purposes typically include business, legal or tax purposes. If these purposes no longer apply, we will destroy or de-identify the information according to our internal policies and procedures.
Access To Our Records About You
Under the Cable Privacy Law, cable customers have the right to inspect our records that contain personally identifiable information about them and to have a reasonable opportunity to correct any errors in such information. If you wish to exercise this right, please notify us at the local Mediacom office specified on your bill and we will contact you to arrange a mutually convenient time during our regular business hours.
If you make an affirmative, written request for a copy of your CPNI, we will disclose the relevant information that we have collected to you, or to any person properly designated by you, if we reasonably believe the request is valid. Subscribers to our phone Service should be aware that we cannot correct any errors in customer names, addresses or phone numbers appearing in, or omitted from, our or our vendors' directory lists until the next scheduled publication of those directory lists. Further, we may have no control over information appearing in the directory lists or directory assistance services of directory publishers or directory assistance providers which are not owned by us or our subsidiaries.
Remedies If Your Rights Are Violated
If Mediacom violates the Cable Privacy Law, the Telecommunications Privacy Law or other applicable privacy law, you may have remedies that include seeking actual, liquidated and/or punitive damages, attorneys' fees and costs in a lawsuit. Mediacom's subscriber, customer or other service agreement applicable to your Services may provide that, to the extent permitted by law, (i) any claims that you have will be decided in arbitration and attorneys' fees and punitive damages will not be available and (ii) such claims must be brought on an individual basis so that a "class action" on behalf of all of our customers who may have similar claims are not allowed.

Use And Disclosure Of Information That Is Not Personally Identifiable Information Or CPNI. As noted above, we obtain by a variety of methods and from a variety of sources information that pertains to you or your use
of our Services but that is not personally identifiable information or CPNI because it is not associated with your name or other identifying information or any such association has been removed. Mediacom believes that neither the Cable Privacy Law nor the Telecommunications Law imposes any restriction upon our collection, use or disclosure of such anonymous, de-identified or aggregate information and so its collection, use and disclosure is entirely within our discretion. Any statement or disclosure we make in this Notice regarding how we collect, use or disclose such information is a voluntary disclosure that does not limit our discretion, create any commitment or liability with respect to such collection, use or disclosure or prevent us from changing the policies or practices disclosed without notice or consent. Updates To This Notice
We may change this Notice periodically as we deem appropriate. We will notify you of any material changes affecting personally identifiable information or CPNI by posting the revised notice on our website or by written or electronic correspondence. Your use of any of the Service(s) following the notification shall constitute your acceptance of and consent to the revised Privacy Notice. Contact Your Local Mediacom Office If You Have Questions
If you have any questions about our policies described in this Notice, please contact your local Mediacom office at the address and telephone number listed on your bill (or, if you have not yet been billed, on the service order you signed to subscribe to the service).
