In no case will Aruba resell any of your personal information to third parties nor use it for any purpose not stated. In particular, your data will be processed for:
a) registration and contact information, and/or informational materials Your personal data is processed to implement preliminary actions and those following a registration request, to manage information and contact requests, and/or to send informational materials, as well as to satisfy any and all other obligations arising herewith. The legal basis for this processing is to provide the services relating to a request for registration, information and contact, and/or the sending of informational materials, and to comply with legal requirements.
b) administering the contractual relationship Your personal data is processed to implement preliminary actions and those following the purchase of a Service and/or a Product, to manage the applicable order, to perform the Service itself and/or for production and/or shipping of the purchased Product, the associated invoicing and payment management, handling of any returns and/or notifications to the support service and performance of the support itself, fraud prevention, as well as fulfillment of any and all other requirements arising from the contract. The legal basis for this processing is to provide the services relating to the contractual relationship and to comply with legal requirements.
c) promotional activities on Services/Products that are similar to those you have purchased (Clause 47 GDPR) The Data Controller, even without your explicit consent, may use the contact information you provided for direct sales of its own Services/Products, limited to those Services/Products that are similar to the ones included in the sale, unless you specifically refuse.
d) business promotional activities on Services/Products that are different from the ones you purchased Your personal data may also be processed for business promotional purposes, for market research studies involving the Services/Products that the Data Controller offers, but only if you have authorized this processing and have not opposed it.

e) digital security The Data Controller, in line with the provisions of Clause 49 of the GDPR and through its providers (third parties and/or recipients), processes your personal data involving traffic only to the extent strictly necessary and proportional to guarantee security of the networks and the information. This means the capacity of a network or information system to block, at a given level of security, any unforeseen events or illegal or malicious acts that would compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of the personal data stored or transmitted. The Data Controller will immediately notify you if there is any risk of violation of your data, except for any obligations noted in the provisions of Art. 33 GDPR associated with notifications of personal data violations. The legal basis for this processing is to comply with legal requirements and the legitimate interests of the Data Controller in undertaking processing for the purpose of protecting corporate assets and the security of the Aruba Group's offices and systems.
f) profiling
Your personal data may also be processed for profiling purposes (such as analyzing the transmitted data and the pre-selected Services/Products, suggesting advertising messages and/or business offers in line with user selections) exclusively when you have given explicit and informed consent. The legal basis for this processing is the consent you initially granted for the processing itself, which you may freely withdraw at any time (see Section III).
g) fraud prevention (Clause 47 and Art. 22 GDPR)  Your personal data, except for private data (Art. 9 GDPR) or legal information (Art. 10 GDPR) will be processed to allow controls for monitoring purposes and prevention of fraudulent payments. This processing will be done by software systems that run automated checks and will be carried out prior to negotiating Services/Products;  a negative result on these checks will render the transaction impossible; you can, in any case, express your opinion, obtain an explanation or dispute the decision by outlining your reasons to the Customer Support Department or to the contact privacy@staff.aruba.it;  personal data collected only for anti-fraud purposes, which differs from the data needed for the proper performance of the service requested, shall be immediately deleted upon termination of the verification phase.
h) protection of minors The Services/Products offered by the Controller are reserved for those entities legally able, based on national regulations, to satisfy contractual obligations. The Controller, to prevent illegal access to its own services, implements preventive measures to protect its own interests, such as checking tax identification numbers or, when necessary for specific Services/Products, the accuracy of the identification data on the identification documents issued by the applicable authorities.
Communication to third parties and categories of recipients (Article 13, paragraph 1 GDPR) Your personal data is communicated mainly to third parties and/or recipients whose activity is necessary to perform the activities relating to the contract established, and to meet certain legal requirements, such as:

SECTION III

What happens when you do not provide your identification information as needed to perform the requested service? (Article 13, paragraph 2 (e) GDPR)

What happens when you do not provide the consent for processing personal data for the business promotion activities on Services/Products that are different from those purchased?
When you do not give your consent to the processing of your personal data for these purposes, the processing will not be implemented for these specific purposes, but it will not affect the performance of the requested services or those for which you have already given your consent, if requested. In the event you have given consent and later withdraw it or oppose the processing for business promotional activities, your data will no longer be processed for these activities, although this will not create negative effects or consequences for you or the services requested.
How we process your data (Article 32, GDPR)
The Controller makes use of appropriate security measures to preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of your personal data, and requires the same security measures from third party providers and the Processors.
Where we process your data
Your data is stored in hard copy, electronic and remote archives located in countries where the GDPR is applicable (EU countries).
How long is your data stored? (Article 13, paragraph 2 (a) GDPR) Unless you explicitly express your own desire to remove it, your personal data will be stored until required for the due purposes for which it was collected. In particular, the data will be stored for the entire duration of your registration and in any case for no longer than a maximum period of 12 (twelve) months of inactivity, that is, within this time period, there have been no Services and/or Products purchased using this registration. For data provided to the Controller for the purposes of business promotion for services other than those you have already purchased, for which you initially gave consent, it will be stored for 24months, except when such consent is withdrawn. For data provided to the Controller for the purposes of profiling, it will be stored for 12 months, again except when consent has been withdrawn. It is also important to add that, should the user forward to Aruba personal data that has not been requested or that is unnecessary for the purposes of performing the services requested, or for the performance of services strictly connected thereto, Aruba cannot be considered controller of this data and will proceed to delete it as soon as possible. Regardless of your determination to remove the data, your personal information will be, in any case, stored according to the terms outlined in current law and/or national regulations, for the exclusive purpose of guaranteeing specific requirements, applicable to certain Services (for example, but not limited to, Certified Electronic Mail, Digital Signature, Digital Preservation - refer to the associated section). Furthermore, personal data will in any case be stored to comply with obligations (e.g. tax and accounting purposes) which may continue even after termination of the contract (Art. 2220 Civil Code); for these purposes, the Controller shall retain only the data necessary to complete these activities. For those cases where the rights arising from the contract and/or registration are used in the courts, your personal data, exclusively required for these purposes, shall be processed for the time necessary to complete them.
